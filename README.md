# AI_Osteoarthritis_Severity_Assessment
AI-Driven Osteoarthritis Severity Assessment and Personalized Treatment Recommendation System

Overview
This project uses deep learning models to analyze X-ray/MRI images of joints (knee/hip) to assess the severity of osteoarthritis and provide personalized treatment recommendations based on both image analysis and patient data.

Core Objectives
Develop a deep learning model to analyze X-ray or MRI images and assess osteoarthritis severity.
Monitor disease progression over time.
Integrate patient data to generate personalized treatment recommendations.
Features
Severity Assessment: Quantifies radiographic features like joint space narrowing and osteophyte formation.
Personalized Recommendations: Suggests treatment options based on severity and patient characteristics (e.g., age, pain severity).
Explainability: Clear explanations for treatment suggestions for both patients and clinicians.
Folder Structure
data/: Contains raw and preprocessed medical imaging data.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for model development and training.
models/: Trained models (CNN for severity assessment, recommendation model).
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and inference.
frontend/: (Optional) User interface for clinicians to upload images and view results.
backend/: Code to manage data flow and handle model predictions.
database/: SQL/NoSQL database configuration for storing patient data.

Setup Instructions
  1. Clone the repository:
      git clone https://github.com/yourusername/AI_Osteoarthritis_Severity_Assessment.git
      cd AI_Osteoarthritis_Severity_Assessment
 2. Install Dependencies: Make sure you have Python 3.x installed. Install the dependencies from requirements.txt
      pip install -r requirements.txt
 3. Prepare Data:
    Place your raw images (X-rays/MRIs) in the data/raw/ folder.
    Run the preprocessing script:
      python scripts/preprocess.py
 4. Train the Model: To train the severity assessment model, use:
    python scripts/train_cnn.py
 5. Run the Backend: Use Flask or Django to serve the model and handle requests:
    python backend/app.py
 6. (Optional) Run Frontend: If you're building a UI for this, follow the instructions inside the frontend/ folder to run the React app.

Technologies Used
Deep Learning: TensorFlow/Keras for model training.
Backend: Flask/Django to serve the model and handle data.
Frontend: React.js for a clinician-friendly interface.
Database: MySQL/PostgreSQL for patient and image data storage.
Future Improvements
Multimodal Imaging (X-ray, MRI, Ultrasound)
Disease progression prediction
Integration of patient-reported outcomes for better personalization
